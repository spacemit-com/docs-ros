# Node-RED Usage Guide

This guide shows how to run **Node-RED** inside Docker on the **Bianbu system**.

## Introduction

**Node-RED** is a **flow-based, visual programming tool** originally created by IBM engineers and now maintained by the open-source community (with support from the JS Foundation).

It is mainly used for

- **event-driven application integration**
- **IoT (Internet of Things) development**
- **API orchestration**
- **Automation**

### Key Features

1. **Low-code / Visual Programming**

   - Build logic by **dragging and dropping nodes** and connecting them with **wires**.
   - Minimal coding required to create powerful flows.

2. **Built on Node.js**

   - Runs on top of Node.js.
   - Lightweight, suitable for embedded devices and cloud platforms.

3. **Built-in and Extendable Nodes**

   - Includes numerous pre-built nodes: HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket, file system, function processing, etc.
   - Extend functionality via **npm** with community-contributed nodes (databases, AI services, chatbots, Slack, Telegram, robotics, and more).

4. **Designed for IoT**

   - Easy integration with **sensors, devices, and cloud services** using MQTT, REST APIs, or Modbus protocol.
   - Popular for **smart home** and **industrial IoT** projects.

5. **Highly Extensible**

   - Add custom logic with **JavaScript function nodes**.
   - Integrate with databases (MongoDB, MySQL, Redis), messaging systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ), and AI services (TensorFlow\.js, OpenAI API).

## Pull the Image

Run the following command to download the latest Node-RED Docker image:

```bash
sudo docker pull harbor.spacemit.com/bianbu-robot/node-red-image:latest
```

## Start Node-RED

Launch the Node-RED service with:

```bash
sudo docker run -it \
  -p 1880:1880 \
  -v node_red_data:/data \
  --name node-red-test \
  harbor.spacemit.com/bianbu-robot/node-red-image:latest
```

Command breakdown

- `docker run`
   Runs a container. If the image isn’t available locally, it will be downloaded first.
- `-it`
   Opens an interactive terminal so you can see the container’s output in real time.
- `-p 1880:1880`
   Maps port `1880` on your local machine to port `1880` inside the container.
- `-v node_red_data:/data`
   Mounts a Docker volume named `node_red_data` to the container’s `/data` directory. This ensures your flow changes are saved. You can also use a local path instead of `node_red_data`.
- `--name node-red-test`
    Gives the container a recognizable name.
- `harbor.spacemit.com/bianbu-robot/node-red-image:latest`
   Specifies the base image to use.

**Terminal output example:**

## Access the Node-RED Dashboard

Open a browser on your x86 PC and visit http://board_ip:1880/

**Note:** Replace `board_ip` with your development board’s actual IP address.

The interface will look like this:

### Manage the Container

- Run in background
  To detach from the container but keep it running, press **Ctrl+p** then **Ctrl+q**.

- To reattach to the terminal and view logs:  

   ```bash
   docker attach node-red-test
   ```

- To restart the container (e.g., after a system or Docker service restart):  

   ```bash
   docker start node-red-test
   ```

- To stop the container:  

   ```bash
   docker stop node-red-test
   ```
