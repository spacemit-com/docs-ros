# 2.2 Development Documentation Index

This section provides an entry point to the key software documentation required for robot development on the SpacemiT platform.

## Buildroot Development Guide (BSP & Low-Level System)

**[Buildroot](https://www.spacemit.com/community/document/info?lang=en&nodepath=software/SDK/buildroot/root_overview.md)** serves as the **Board Support Package (BSP) and embedded Linux SDK** for SpacemiT Stone series chips.  It provides a complete embedded Linux build environment including:

- OpenSBI (Supervisor Binary Interface)
- U-Boot / UEFI (bootloader)
- Linux Kernel
- RootFS (with integrated middleware and system libraries)
- Example applications and development tools

Its goal is to provide full Linux enablement for the processor and accelerate driver and low-level system development.
