# 2.7 Automatic Startup on Boot

```
Last Version: 10/09/2025
```

This guide explains how to make your program start automatically when the system boots.
We’ll use a **systemd user service**, which applies to **Bianbu system**.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Program for Automatic Startup

Before setting up auto-start, confirm your program runs correctly **from the command line**. Examples:

- Python script:

  ```bash
  python demo.py
  ```

- Bash script:

  ```bash
  bash executable_file
  ```

- Node.js project:

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

## Step 2: Create the systemd Service File

In your working directory, create a new file named `demo.service` with the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Demo Service

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/workspace
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'exec /path/to/your/workspace/executable_file'
Restart=on-failure
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
Environment=SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug
Environment=PYTHONPATH=/if/you/need

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

> **Note:**
>
> - **`WorkingDirectory`**: Enter the path to your working directory.
> - **`ExecStart`**: Enter your startup command or the path to your executable file.
> - To add environment variables, just add more **`Environment`** lines.

## Step 3: Install the Service File

Copy the `demo.service` file to the `~/.config/systemd/user/` or `/usr/lib/systemd/user/` directory
(the former is recommended, as user-level services do not require root permissions).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp demo.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
```

## Step 4: Enable and Start the Service

1. Enable the service to start automatically at boot:

   ```bash
   systemctl --user enable demo.service
   ```

2. Start the service:

   ```bash
   systemctl --user start demo.service
   ```

3. Check the service status:

   ```bash
   systemctl --user status demo.service
   ```

A `running` status indicates that the service is currently active:

## Step 5: Verify Automatic Startup at Boot

Reboot your system, then run:

```bash
systemctl --user status demo.service
```

If configured correctly, it will be active automatically.

## Common Issues

- If you encounter permission issues, make sure your user has a systemd user instance enabled.

- Logs can be viewed using:

   ```bash
   journalctl --user -u demo.service
   ```

- If the service does not start automatically, check the service file path, permissions, and whether the `ExecStart` command is correct.
