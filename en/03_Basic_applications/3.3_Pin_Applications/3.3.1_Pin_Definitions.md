**Pin Function Description:**

- **Input**:
  - Receives electrical signals.
  - Commonly used to read peripheral status, such as button presses, using libraries like `gpiozero`.

- **Output**:
  - Outputs high or low voltage levels (0V or 3.3V).
  - Typically used to control LEDs or relays.

- **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)**:
  - Supports PWM waveform output.
  - Can control servos, motors, or create effects like breathing/fading lights.
