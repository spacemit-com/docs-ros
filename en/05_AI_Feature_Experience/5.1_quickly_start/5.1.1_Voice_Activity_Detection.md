# 5.1.1 Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

## Overview

This section introduces how to use **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** models to automatically **detect human speech** and **control recording behavior**. The system will

- **Start recording** when speech is detected.
- **Stop recording** when silence is detected.

## Preparation

### Download Model Files

```bash
wget -O ~/.cache/sensevoice.tar.gz https://archive.spacemit.com/spacemit-ai/openwebui/sensevoice.tar.gz 
tar -xzf ~/.cache/sensevoice.tar.gz -C ~/.cache
rm ~/.cache/sensevoice.tar.gz
```

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/bianbu/spacemit-demo.git
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install onnxruntime python3-spacemit-ort
sudo apt install python3-numpy
sudo apt install python3-pyaudio
```

## Detect System Recording Devices

You need to know the correct **device index** for your microphone or recording device. There are two ways to find this.

### Method 1: Using `arecord`

Run the following command to view the system's recording device list:

```bash
arecord -l
```

Sample output:

Record the device index number you need to use.

### Method 2: Automatic Device Search Script

Alternatively, run the following script to list all recording devices:

```bash
python3 01_search_device.py
```

Sample output:
