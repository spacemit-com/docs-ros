# 7.3 Netdata Tutorial

## Overview

Netdata is a real-time performance monitoring and visualization tool that tracks both system-level and application-level metrics.

**Key features**:

- **Real-time monitoring**: Refreshes system and application metrics every second
- **Rich visualizations**: Provides web dashboards, charts, and alerts
- **Lightweight**: Low overhead with minimal impact on production systems
- **Multi-platform support**: Linux, BSD, Docker, and more

**Typical use cases:**

- Monitoring system resources (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Analyzing service performance (web servers, databases, etc.)
- Detecting anomalies and setting alerts

**Official documentation:** [https://learn.netdata.cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud/)

## Netdata Installation

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install netdata
```

## Starting and Accessing Netdata

### Start the Service

```bash
sudo systemctl start netdata
sudo systemctl enable netdata
```

### Stop and Restart

```bash
sudo systemctl stop netdata
sudo systemctl restart netdata
```

### Access the Web Interface

#### Local Access

Netdata listens on port **19999** by default. After installation, access it via your browser at:

```
http://localhost:19999/
```

The web interface displays real-time metrics for CPU, memory, disk, network, processes, etc.

#### LAN Access

To allow other machines on your local network to access Netdata, modify the configuration file:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/netdata/netdata.conf
```

Locate the configuration line:

```bash
bind socket to IP = 127.0.0.1
```

Change it to:

```bash
bind socket to IP = 0.0.0.0
```

Restart the service for changes to take effect:

```
sudo systemctl restart netdata
```

Access Netdata from other machines using `http://<server-IP>:19999/`.

## Key Monitoring Metrics

By default, Netdata automatically tracks:

| Category | Example Metrics |
|----------|-----------------|
| CPU | Usage, load, frequency, context switches |
| Memory | Usage, cache, swap space |
| Disk | I/O read/write rates, latency, disk queues |
| Network | Bandwidth, traffic, packet loss |
| System | Process count, file handles, user login info |
| Services | Web servers, databases, containers (requires plugins) |

### Process Monitoring

The web interface shows CPU, memory, and thread counts for each process, with sorting and filtering options.

### Application monitoring (via plugins)

Plugins extend Netdata to track applications like:

- Nginx / Apache
- MySQL / PostgreSQL
- Docker / Kubernetes

Once installed, these metrics appear automatically the web interface.

## Netdata Configuration

### Configuration File Location

Netdata's main configuration file is located at:

```
/etc/netdata/netdata.conf
```

Common configuration options:

- `bind socket to IP = 127.0.0.1`
   Indicates the target monitoring address for the Web interface
  - Default `127.0.0.1`: Local access only
  - Change to `0.0.0.0`: Allow access from any LAN IP
- `run as user = netdata`
   Specifies the user account that runs the Netdata service (default: `netdata`). It operates with minimal privileges to improve security.
- `web files owner = root`
   Sets ownership of web interface files (typically `root`) to prevent unauthorized modifications
- `web files group = root`
   Specifies the group for web interface files (default: `root`), used together with `owner`.

Restart the service after configuration changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart netdata
```

### Configuration Alert

Alert configuration files are located in:

```
/etc/netdata/health.d/
```

Example custom threshold:

```ini
alarm: high_cpu
on: system.cpu
calc: $usage > 90
every: 10s
warn: $usage > 80
info: CPU usage exceeds threshold
```

> Triggers alerts when CPU usage exceeds 90%, with notifications via email or Slack.

## Advanced Features

### Multi-node Monitoring

- Supports **Master/Child** mode
- Master node collects data from multiple child nodes for centralized management

### Data Export

- Works with Prometheus, Graphite, and other data collectors
- Access historical data and create custom reports via API
